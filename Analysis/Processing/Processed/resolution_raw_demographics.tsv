2022-03-29 14:54:06	Male	35	Bachelor degree	Australia	I have seen computer graphics on tv, in films, in video games or in other media	normal vision	557.934	I found that throughout the test i was making rules for myself. The smaller individual dots the better, stronger green towards the rocks indicating more shadows throughout the day and lighter colors further away as they are in the sun. Also the grouping being more erratic was more realistic, not circular grouping but random shapes.

(Maybe add that as a demographic question; e.g. how would you rate your lichen knowledge or something along those lines)

Mostly because the desired answer was "what looks the most realistic", but sometimes I wanted to pick another "generated lichen" because it suited better in the environment.   Overall looks good, except for the lichen which looked like a bunch of strings. Often felt drawn to the results with the most combinations of different colored lichen together.

I think I answered correctly but I wouldn't know without doing some research and not everyone will be up for that. In the few where both images had very small patches, I could have gone either way.
