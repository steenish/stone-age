2022-03-30 09:38:22	Female	25	Bachelor degree	Sweden	I have limited experience creating computer graphics (e.g. as a hobby or in a university course)	normal vision	708.014	I got the impression that many of the pairs were hard to distinguish from one another. While that might be intentional, I found that lichen that is smaller and more dense looks more realistic than the ones that are modelled as bigger blobs of larger pieces.  I think this was very interesting and it would have been nice to know how you intend to interpret/work with this data. Are you taking a hci-approach and looking into how people perceive the graphics, or is the aim more to examine the quality of what graphics can be generated? I will definitely look into this project once it is published!   Thanks!

I don't know if that was due to them casting hard shadows or having some applied border, but those which appeared thinner definitely looked better on that kind of stone.   Maybe thicker lichens would look better on i.e a rough and jagged granite surface or the trunk of a tree?

Randomness is always preferred.  I think there should be a longer process of getting to know the 'lichi' because "what I sense is a realistic 'lichi'" changed two times during the process..

Besides, I wonder if it's influenced by the fact that the images are simulated, I feel all the images look not very realistic.

Some images I didn't think any of them were more realistic than the other but I had to choose.

For these situations a scale (like "Left" "Mostly Left" "Neither" "Mostly Right" and "Right") would've have given a more representable option for me. Or just a simple "Neither" would probably suffice.

Just wanted to point out in case this wasn't intended, so that you're aware that people had to choose one even if they felt they were identical.

Thin and sparse ones look really nice, well done.  The buttons Left and Right were really small and only visible with a zoom at 80% on my browser (1920x1080 resolution)  The experience is a bit repetitive. Sometimes it lacks of an option "None of this pictures is realistic at all", even though this probably complexify the analysis of the data. By the way, I do not think that the gender is a relevant demographic data here.  At first, I did not understand that the rocky ground was a rock. I just thought it was the floor.  I wish you to succeed in your work, it's an interesting topic.
